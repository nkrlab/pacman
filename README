Introduction
===============================================================================
This is an example project that illustrates how to use the Nexon Funapi.
It consists of a client part and a server part. You need to build both of them
to test.


===============================================================================
How to compile
===============================================================================
Both of client and server can be built using trivial `configure && make'.

$ cd client  (or cd server)
$ ./boot.sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure
$ make


===============================================================================
How to run
===============================================================================
First run the server. After building a server, you can see a file named
`pacman-launcher'. This is a shell script which pre-loads required libraries
including Funapi. Simply run the script.

$ cd server/build;
$ ./pacman-launcher


Next, run the client.

$ cd client/build;
$ ./pacman


===============================================================================
How to play
===============================================================================
Login screen shows up, you can enter id and password.
For now, any word will be okay for purpose of test.


Next, you can see a list of room. (a.k.a lobby)
If you want to refresh room list, use 'l' key.
If you want to make a room, use 'c' key.
In make room screen, you can choose a duel or single room using space key.
If you want to logout, use 'q' key.


If you made a duel room, you will wait for other player's join.
When other player join to your room, game start automatically.


Or you may want to join to other player's room.
In this case, you should use 'j' key in lobby and enter room number.


You can control Pacman using arrow keys, and 'q' key  will return to lobby.


Any time you want to terminate client immediately, Ctrl+C key will help you.
but it is not recommanded because it does not logout.


Enjoy the game!
