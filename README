Introduction
===============================================================================
This is an example project that illustrates how to use the Nexon Funapi.
It consists of a client part and a server part. You need to build both of them
to test.


===============================================================================
How to compile
===============================================================================
Both of client and server can be built using trivial `configure && make'.

$ cd client  (or cd server)
$ ./boot.sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure
$ make


===============================================================================
How to run
===============================================================================
First run the server. After building a server, you can see a file named
`pacman-launcher'. This is a shell script which pre-loads required libraries
including Funapi. Simply run the script.

$ cd server/build; ./pacman-launcher


Next, run the client.

$ cd client/build; ./pacman


And then login screen shows up, you can enter id and password.
For now, any word will be okay for purpose of test.


You can control Pacman using arrow keys, and Ctrl+C will terminate the client.
If you want to logout, use `q' key.


Enjoy the game!
