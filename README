===============================================================================
Introduction
===============================================================================
This is an example project that illustrates how to use the Nexon Funapi.
It consists of a client part and a server part. You need to build both of them
to test.


===============================================================================
How to compile
===============================================================================
Both of client and server can be built using trivial `configure && make'.

$ cd client  (or cd server)
$ ./boot.sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure
$ make


===============================================================================
How to run
===============================================================================
First run the server. After building a server, you can see a file named
`pacman-launcher'. This is a shell script which pre-loads required libraries
including Funapi. Simply run the script.

$ cd server/build; ./pacman-launcher


Next, run the client.

$ cd client/build; ./pacman


You can control Pacman using arrow keys, and Ctrl+C will terminate the client.
Depending on branch, you may be able to use `q' key to return to the top menu.

Enjoy the game!
